# Q5. Duplicate File Finder and Cleaner
# Write a Python script to find duplicate files within a specified directory and its subdirectories. The script should:
# Scan the directory for all files and calculate a checksum (e.g., sha256sum) for each file.
# Identify and list duplicate files by comparing their checksums.
# Optionally, give the user the option to delete or move duplicate files.
# Bonus:
# Allow the user to specify the minimum file size for duplication detection (e.g., only consider files larger than 1MB).
# Create a report listing the duplicate files and their checksums.
